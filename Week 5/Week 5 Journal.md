# Introduction 

## Resonances

**What is counted—like being a man or a woman—often becomes the basis for policymaking and resource allocation. By contrast, what is not counted—like being nonbinary—becomes invisible.**
	- What we record is significant because it shapes our perceptions of the group we are recording. Whenever we record information, we (whether intentionally or not) impose our own cultural lens/filter/baggage on the information we record.

## Response to the Prompts
- This is why diversity is important in archaeology, as people from different cultures will likely investigate/ask different questions about the past. The more diverse our research questions are, the more rich our knowledge becomes.
   
- This ties in to some of the material ive studied from HIST 2706 (Ancient and pre-colonial Africa)
    
- There is a cultural narrative that Ancient Egypt was the most significant, sophisticated ancient civilization in northern Africa. Although ancient Egypt was an incredible civilization, its neighbors along the Nile including Nubia, Kush, and Ethiopia all have equally or even more rich histories than ancient Egypt. In fact, from a historians perspective it would be logical to study all these civilizations together given the amount of intermingling and conflict that occurred between them. However, an archaeologist by the name of George Andrew Reisner (Who belonged to an era of, and participated in, racism) depicted Ancient Egypt as vastly superior to Nubia, based on Egyptian hieroglyphs (which were essentially propaganda). At the time, it was important to include Egypt in Semitic texts for biblical studies. This lead to Reisner and other archaeologists separating ancient Egypt from the rest of Africa through Race, effectively whitewashing Egyptian history by making it part of a dominant western culture. Nubia was depicted as “Black”, and thus was separated from Egypt and dismissed as an adjunct to the “dominant” Egyptian civilization.

- Changing the form we use to record gravestone data is not as easy as it sounds. As mentioned in the chapter by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein if a choice is confined to a binary or set of pre-defined options, whoever is entering the data is constrained to those choices. The chapter uses Facebook as an example for one way to resolve this, which was to make gender a open field, allowing users to input any word they wished to define their gender. What stands out to me here is how this makes working with the data infinitely more complicated. Lets take that field as an example. Lets say a new user is creating their profile, and arrives at the gender field. If they misread “gender” as “Genre”, they may input their favorite genre as “Science-Fiction”. Assumingly since they misread the field, this data has nothing to do with their gender identity. However, since the field for this data is completely open, “Science-Fiction” gets recorded. Since this information isn’t useful for Facebook (who makes money selling peoples data) They rely on other data to *determine your gender for you*. D’Ignazio and Klein speak to this as well, identifying the problem with an organization such as Facebook holding this power. This leaves me with the question… which is better for the user, or whoever is being recorded? Is it better to fit someones data into a set of predefined categories that are self-recorded, thus giving them the power to choose how they are defined in an arbitrary system? Or, should we minimize classification systems and prioritize having more open fields to better reflect the subject, but transfer the power of the final depiction or definition of that individual to an organization/archaeologist who is interpreting the data? Surely there is no one-size-fits all solution, what about the subjects of our project? The deceased cannot make this decision for themselves, so which best represents them?
